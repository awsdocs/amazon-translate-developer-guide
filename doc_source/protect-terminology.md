# Encrypting Your Terminology<a name="protect-terminology"></a>

Amazon Translate endeavors to protect all of your data and your custom terminologies are no different\. When created, each custom terminology is encrypted so it accessible only by you\.

Three encryption options are available:
+ Using AWS encryption\. This is the default option and is used to safeguard your information if you don't choose another method\.
+ Using an encryption key associated with your account\. If this is chosen, a menu in the console provides you with a choice of associated encryption keys to use\.
+ Using an encryption key not associated with your account\. If you choose this option, a box is displayed in the console for you to enter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the encryption key\.
