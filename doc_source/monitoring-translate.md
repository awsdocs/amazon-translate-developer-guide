# Monitoring Amazon Translate<a name="monitoring-translate"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon Translate and your solutions\. AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor Amazon Translate\. You can configure some of these tools to monitor your solutions for you\. We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible\.

Amazon Translate provides preconfigured graphs that show you the most important metrics for your solution\. Each graph offers a window into your solution's performance\. To get different views of how your solution is performing over time, you can change the time range that the graphs show\.

You can also use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor Amazon Translate\. With CloudWatch, you can automate monitoring specific metrics for your solutions\. You receive a notice whenever a metric is outside of the thresholds that you set\. You can also use the CloudWatch API to create a custom monitoring application that is suitable for your needs\. For more information, see [What is Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

The following table describes each of the preconfigured graphs provided by Amazon Translate\.


| Graph | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-successful-request-count.png) |  Successful request count The number of successful requests made to Amazon Translate during the specified time period\.  | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-throttled-request-count.png) | Throttled request countThe number of requests to Amazon Translate that were throttled during the specified time period\. Use this information to determine if your application is sending requests to Amazon Translate too quickly\. | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-average-response-time.png) |  Average response time The average length of time that it took Amazon Translate to process your request during the specified time period\.  | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-character-count.png) | Character countThe total number of characters that you sent to Amazon Translate during the specified time period\. This is the number of characters that you will be billed for\. | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-user-error-count.png) | User error countThe number of user errors that occurred during the specified time period\. User errors are in the HTTP error code range 400\-499\. | 
| ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/images/metric-system-error-count.png) | System error countThe number of system errors that occurred during the specified time period\. System errors are in the HTTP error code range 500\-599\. | 

## Monitoring Amazon Translate<a name="monitoring-translate-cloudwatch"></a>

With Amazon CloudWatch, you can get metrics for individual Amazon Translate operations or global Amazon Translate metrics for your account\. Use metrics to track the health of your Amazon Translate solutions and to set up alarms to notify you when one or more metrics fall outside a defined threshold\. For example, you can monitor the number of requests made to Amazon Translate in a particular time period, see the latency of requests, or raise an alarm when errors exceed a threshold\.

### Understanding CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Translate<a name="aws-lex-cloudwatch-using"></a>

To get metrics for your Amazon Translate operations, you specify the following information:
+ The metric dimension\. A *dimension* is a set of name\-value pairs that you use to identify a metric\. Amazon Translate has two dimensions:
  + `Operation`
  + `Language pair`
+ The metric name, such as `SuccessfulRequestCount` or `RequestCharacters`\. For a complete list of metrics, see [CloudWatch Metrics for Amazon Translate](translate-cloudwatch.md#translate-cloudwatch-metrics)\.

You can get metrics for Amazon Translate with the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudWatch API\. You can use the CloudWatch API through one of the Amazon AWS Software Development Kits \(SDKs\) or the CloudWatch API tools\. 

The following table lists some common uses for CloudWatch metrics\. These are suggestions to get you started, not a comprehensive list\.


| How do I? | Monitor this metric | 
| --- | --- | 
| Track the number of successful requests | The sum statistic of the SuccessfulRequestCount metric  | 
| Know if my application has reached its maximum throughput | The sum statistic of the ThrottledCount metric | 
| Find the response time for my application | The average statistic of the ResponseTime metric | 
| Find the number of errors for my application | The sum statistic of the ServerErrorCount and UserErrorCount metrics | 
| Find the number of billable characters | The sum statistic of the CharacterCount metric | 

You must have the appropriate CloudWatch permissions to monitor Amazon Translate with CloudWatch For more information, see [ Authentication and Access Control for Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
