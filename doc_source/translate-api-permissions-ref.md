# Amazon Translate API permissions: Actions, resources, and conditions reference<a name="translate-api-permissions-ref"></a>

You can specify permitted Amazon Translate operations in the pemission policies that you attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\)\. You specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field\. 

To specify an action, use the `translate:` prefix followed by the API operation name, such as `translate:TranslateText`\.

You can also use AWS\-wide condition keys in your Amazon Translate policies\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

For details about the Amazon Translate operations and resources, see [ Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Translate ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazontranslate.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference*\.
