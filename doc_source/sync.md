# Real\-time translation<a name="sync"></a>

To translate a single text document and return the results of that translation directly to your application, use the Amazon Translate real\-time translation operation, [TranslateText](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/APIReference/API_TranslateText.html)\. Use this translation mode for interactive applications that work on one document at a time\.

For an example of a real\-time translation workflow, see [Translate text using the command line](get-started-cli.md#cli-command-line)\.
