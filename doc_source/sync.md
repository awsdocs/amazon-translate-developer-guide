# Real\-Time Translation<a name="sync"></a>

To translate a single text document and return the results of that translation directly to your application, use the Amazon Translate real\-time translation operation, [TranslateText](API_TranslateText.md)\. Use this translation mode for interactive applications that work on one document at a time\.

For an example of a real\-time translation workflow, see [Translate Text Using the Command Line](get-started-cli.md#cli-command-line)\.
